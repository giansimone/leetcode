    "# [2551. Put Marbles in Bags](https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You have ```k``` bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array ```weights``` where ```weights[i]``` is the weight of the ```ith``` marble. You are also given the integer ```k```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the marbles into the ```k``` bags according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ No bag is empty.\n",
    "+ If the ```ith``` marble and ```jth``` marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ```ith``` and ```jth``` indices should also be in that same bag.\n",
    "+ If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from ```i``` to ```j``` inclusively, then the cost of the bag is ```weights[i] + weights[j]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the ```k``` bags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. \n",
    "The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. \n",
    "Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: weights = [1, 3], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. \n",
    "Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ```1 <= k <= weights.length <= 10^5```\n",
    "+ ```1 <= weights[i] <= 10^9```"
