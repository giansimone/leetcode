    "# [1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children\n",
    "+ The depth of the root of the tree is ```0```. if the depth of a node is ```d```, the depth of each of its children is ```d + 1```.\n",
    "+ The lowest common ancestor of a set ```S``` of nodes, is the node ```A``` with the largest depth such that every node in ```S``` is in the subtree with root ```A```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]\n",
    "Output: [2,7,4]\n",
    "Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.\n",
    "The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.\n",
    "Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: root = [1]\n",
    "Output: [1]\n",
    "Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]\n",
    "Output: [2]\n",
    "Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range ```[1, 1000]```.\n",
    "+ ```0 <= Node.val <= 1000```\n",
    "+ The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.\n",
    "\n",
